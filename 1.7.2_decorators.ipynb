    "\n",
    "And we've just seen a very convenient use case: \"printing a log\". Yes that's right, sometimes when you debug a huge code, you know where and when and where the function is used at \"run time\".\n",

    "\n",
    "You could also write the log *inside* the function to get the same result. But that means you have to make the same in every function you want to trace.\n",
